## Background

The Web Cryptography API is an open standard developed by the W3C and *"defines a low-level interface to interacting with cryptographic key material that is managed or exposed by user agents"* (https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/).

Although the Web Cryptography API was developed for JavaScript, the way we use cryptographic functions in applications across programming languages is unique to the language itself. This library aims to keep these operations consistent across languages so that developers can use documentation and knowledge from a well known open-standard to develop their applications easily and consistently. Cryptography is hard, and we hope this library can help all developers on their cryptographic journey.

The documentation and references used throughout this library come from the amazing authors at:
- [W3C Web Cryptography API Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/)
- [Mozilla Web Crypto API Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API)

## Implementation status

This library is still in active development and all algorithms are not yet supported. While we continue working on implementations that we think are priority, we welcome feedback and contributions from our open-source community. Below are algorithms and their usages that have been implemented.

## Getting started

## Algorithms

### HMAC

The **HMAC** algorithm is the implementation of operations described in [ยง29](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#hmac) of the W3C specification.

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/armortal/webcrypto-go"
	"github.com/armortal/webcrypto-go/algorithms/hmac"
)

func main() {
	key, err := webcrypto.Subtle().GenerateKey(
		&hmac.Algorithm{
			KeyGenParams: &hmac.KeyGenParams{
				Hash: "SHA-256",
			},
		}, true, webcrypto.Sign, webcrypto.Verify)

	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	cryptokey := key.(webcrypto.CryptoKey)

	// do something with cryptoKey
}
```

### RSA-OAEP

The **RSA-OAEP** algorithm is the implementation of operations described in [ยง22](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#rsa-oaep) of the W3C specification.

#### generateKey

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/armortal/webcrypto-go"
	"github.com/armortal/webcrypto-go/algorithms/rsa"
)

func main() {
	key, err := webcrypto.Subtle().GenerateKey(
		&rsa.Algorithm{
			Name: "RSA-OAEP",
			HashedKeyGenParams: &rsa.HashedKeyGenParams{
				KeyGenParams: rsa.KeyGenParams{
					ModulusLength: 2048,
					PublicExponent:      *big.NewInt(65537),
				},
				Hash: "SHA-256",
			},

		}, true, webcrypto.Decrypt, webcrypto.Encrypt)

	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	cryptoKeyPair := key.(webcrypto.CryptoKeyPair)

	// do something with cryptoKeyPair
}
```

## SHA

The **SHA** algorithm is the implementation of operations described in [ยง30](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#sha) of the W3C specification.

The implementation in this library uses Go's `io.Reader` as the input to the `digest` method.

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/armortal/webcrypto-go"
	"github.com/armortal/webcrypto-go/algorithms/sha"
)

func main() {
	hash, err := webcrypto.Subtle().Digest(
		&sha.Algorithm{
			Name: "SHA-256",
		}, bytes.NewReader([]byte("helloworld")))

	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// do something with hash
}
```
